    "Fictional Scenario: A new tax reform proposal is being considered at the national level, which would impose a yearly \"wealth tax\" on individuals and families with a net worth exceeding a certain threshold. The tax would take a percentage of these individuals' total wealth each year, above and beyond the income tax they already pay. The proposed goal of this reform is to reduce wealth inequality and generate additional government revenue, which would be directed towards public services like education and healthcare."

    "    \"User: @FreedomEagle, Followers: 130000, Likes: 8500, Shares: 2000. This new wealth tax proposal is a direct attack on the successful individuals who drive our economy. While reducing inequality is a noble goal, punishing success and hard work isn't the answer. Such measures discourage investment and slow down economic growth. We need policies that encourage wealth creation, not penalize it. As a proud conservative, I advocate for less taxation and more freedom. #NoWealthTax #EconomicFreedom\",\n",
    "    \"User: @SocialJusticeNow, Followers: 225000, Likes: 16000, Shares: 4500. The proposed wealth tax is a step in the right direction. It's time we address the staggering wealth inequality in our nation. Asking the ultra-wealthy to contribute a small fraction of their fortune each year isn't punishmentâ€”it's their fair share. The revenue can help fund crucial public services and create more opportunities for all. As a proud progressive, I stand with this proposal. #WealthTax #FairShare\",\n",
    "    \"User: @TheBalancedView, Followers: 150000, Likes: 12000, Shares: 3000. The wealth tax proposal brings up an important debate. On one hand, we need to address wealth inequality and fund public services. On the other hand, we must also consider the potential discouragement of investment and economic growth. Striking a balance between these concerns is key. Perhaps a compromise could be found in implementing the tax with certain protections for investments in job creation. Proud to seek the middle ground. #WealthTaxDebate #BalancedApproach\",\n",
